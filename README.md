# Rwanda 

This is my final project on Rwanda

## Yemen ADM Subdivisions

At first I chose Yemen as my country which is broken down into 22 governorates and further into 333 districts. Along with my adm break down of the whole country, I chose to look at the districts within Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, and Aden, the second most populous governorate of Yemen after Sana'a. As I moved forward in the class, Yemen proved to be too computationally intesive because of the large amount of districts it holds, so I switched my country to Rwanda for the rest of the semester.
